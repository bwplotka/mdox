# Reliable cross-platform comment checker for go files.
# Uses docker and stable linux distro for reliable grep regex and
# to make sure we work on Linux and OS X and oh even Windows! :)
# Main issue is minor incompatibies between grep on various platforms.
#
# Linux: set USE_DOCKER=yes or USE_DOCKER=false to force run in docker
# All other platforms: uses docker by default. Set USE_DOCKER=no or USE_DOCKER=false to override.
#
# Checks Go code comments if they have trailing period (excludes protobuffers and vendor files).
# Comments with more than 3 spaces at beginning are omitted from the check, example: '//    - foo'.
# This does not include top-level comments for funcs and types.
#
# Example:
#   func main() {
#	    // comment without period, will trigger check
#	    //comment without leading space, will trigger check.
#	    // comment without trailing space, will trigger check.
#	    // good comment, leading space, ends with period, no trailing space.
#     //     - more than 3 leading spaces, will pass
#	    app := kingpin.New(filepath.Base(os.Args[0]), "A block storage based long-term storage for Prometheus")
